# OrbitimeVista

OrbitimeVista is a web-based visualization tool designed to simplify the coordination of video calls across different time zones, exclusively tailored for a group of friends. It represents the day (8 AM to 8 PM) with yellow orbits and sunny planets, and the night (8 PM to 8 AM) with black orbits and grey planets, aiding in identifying the optimal time for calls. Beware of the occasional comets that add an element of unpredictability to the visual experience.

This tool was born out of the need to stay connected with friends living in various countries, turning the often cumbersome task of finding a suitable time for everyone into an engaging and interactive experience.

Should you wish to customize this visualization for your circle, feel free to adjust the country names or add your friends' names to the existing setup with your preferred time ranges before deploying it  somewhere like on Heroku. Deploy your version and keep the connections alive, no matter where life takes you and your friends!
